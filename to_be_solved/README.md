# LeetCode Problems to be Solved

This directory contains categorized LeetCode problems organized by algorithmic patterns and data structures. Each category includes popular problems that are frequently asked in technical interviews.

## Categories

### Data Structures
- **[Arrays](./arrays/)** - Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
- **[Strings](./strings/)** - Pattern matching, palindromes, anagrams
- **[Linked Lists](./linked-lists/)** - Pointer manipulation, cycles, merging
- **[Trees](./trees/)** - Binary trees, BST, traversals
- **[Graphs](./graphs/)** - BFS, DFS, shortest paths, topological sort
- **[Hash Table](./hash-table/)** - Frequency counting, lookups, design
- **[Stack & Queue](./stack-queue/)** - LIFO/FIFO operations, monotonic stacks
- **[Heap](./heap/)** - Priority queues, top K problems, merge K sorted

### Algorithms
- **[Dynamic Programming](./dynamic-programming/)** - Optimal substructure, memoization
- **[Backtracking](./backtracking/)** - Generate combinations, permutations, solutions
- **[Binary Search](./binary-search/)** - Search in sorted arrays, binary search on answer
- **[Two Pointers](./two-pointers/)** - Opposite direction, same direction, fast/slow
- **[Sliding Window](./sliding-window/)** - Fixed/variable window, substring problems
- **[Sorting](./sorting/)** - Custom sorting, merge sort, quick sort
- **[Greedy](./greedy/)** - Local optimal choices, interval problems
- **[Math](./math/)** - Number theory, digit manipulation, geometry
- **[Bit Manipulation](./bit-manipulation/)** - XOR properties, bit operations, masks
- **[Design](./design/)** - System design, data structure implementation

## Difficulty Distribution
- **Easy**: Fundamental concepts, basic implementations
- **Medium**: Pattern recognition, optimized solutions
- **Hard**: Complex algorithms, multiple concepts combined

## Study Approach
1. **Start with Easy**: Build foundation with basic problems
2. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize common algorithmic patterns
3. **Practice Regularly**: Solve 1-2 problems daily consistently
4. **Review Solutions**: Understand different approaches and optimizations
5. **Time Yourself**: Practice under interview conditions

## Interview Preparation
These problems cover the most frequently asked questions in technical interviews at major tech companies. Focus on:
- Understanding the pattern rather than memorizing solutions
- Optimizing for both time and space complexity
- Explaining your thought process clearly
- Handling edge cases properly

## Problem Selection
Problems are selected based on:
- Frequency in interviews (2020-2025)
- Fundamental algorithm/data structure concepts
- Pattern recognition importance
- Progression from basic to advanced concepts

Each category folder contains a README with specific problems and their descriptions.
