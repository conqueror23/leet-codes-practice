# Two Pointers Problems

## Opposite Direction Pointers
1. **Two Sum II** (#167) - Find two numbers that sum to target in sorted array
2. **3Sum** (#15) - Find triplets that sum to zero
3. **4Sum** (#18) - Find quadruplets that sum to target
4. **Valid Palindrome** (#125) - Check if string is palindrome
5. **Container With Most Water** (#11) - Find container holding most water
6. **Trapping Rain Water** (#42) - Calculate trapped rainwater

## Same Direction Pointers (Fast/Slow)
1. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** (#26) - Remove duplicates in-place
2. **Remove Element** (#27) - Remove all instances of value
3. **Move Zeroes** (#283) - Move zeros to end
4. **Squares of Sorted Array** (#977) - Square and sort array
5. **Sort Colors** (#75) - Dutch national flag problem

## Sliding Window (Special Two Pointers)
1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** (#3) - Find longest unique substring
2. **Minimum Window Substring** (#76) - Minimum window containing all characters
3. **Sliding Window Maximum** (#239) - Maximum in each window
4. **Longest Repeating Character Replacement** (#424) - Longest substring with k replacements

## Linked List Two Pointers
1. **Linked List Cycle** (#141) - Detect cycle using Floyd's algorithm
2. **Linked List Cycle II** (#142) - Find start of cycle
3. **Middle of Linked List** (#876) - Find middle using slow/fast pointers
4. **Remove Nth Node from End** (#19) - Remove node in one pass

## Key Patterns
- **Opposite Pointers**: Start from both ends, move towards center
- **Fast/Slow Pointers**: Different speeds for cycle detection
- **Sliding Window**: Expand/contract window based on conditions
- **Dutch Flag**: Three-way partitioning with multiple pointers
