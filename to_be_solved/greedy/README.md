## Key Greedy Strategies
- **Local Optimum**: Make locally optimal choice at each step

3. **Fractional Approach**: Take portions when beneficial
4. **Exchange Argument**: Prove greedy choice is optimal

## When to Use Greedy
- **Optimization problems**: Finding minimum or maximum
- **Choice independence**: Current choice doesn't affect future choices
- **Matroid structures**: Mathematical structure supporting greedy
- **Exchange properties**: Can exchange elements without losing optimality
